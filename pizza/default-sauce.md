# fishy pizza sauce
This is the default sauce I use for my homemade pizzas. What makes this sauce special is that it uses anchovies and "San Marzano" tomatoes. "San Marzano" tomatoes can be hard to come by, so if you can’t find any, then order some online because they are worth it.

**Preparation**: 50 min  
**Makes**: sauce for ~8 pizzas

## Ingredients 
  * 0.5 dl olive oil
  * 2 anchovy filets
  * 4 cloves garlic, minced
  * 2 tbsp fresh oregano, chopped
  * 1 tsp dried oregano
  * 1 tsp red pepper flakes
  * 1 tsp sugar
  * 2 cans of whole peeled "San Marzano" tomatoes (400g each)
  
## Directions

1. Add sugar and yiest to your warm water in a seperate bowl. Stir together for a few seconds and then wait. A few minutes after you have disolved the yiest in the sugar-water you should see it alive and reacting. It should start bubbling and foaming. If not, redo step 1. Your yiest might be to old, or you could have killed it with either too cold or hot water.
2. Add your flour to a large mixing bowl. Add salt and mix it together. Then add olive oil, and your sugar-water. Bring it all together, and when you feel like you have the dough under control drop it on the table so you can start the kneading.
3. Knead your dough for 10 minuntes. The best technique is to roll the dough on top of itself, push forward, and repeat. You know your dough is ready when you press it with your finger and it springs back right away.
4. Coat the bowl where the dough will rise with olive oil, and coat the top of the dough too. Cover with plastic-film and place it in the refrigerator to rise for a minimum of 24 hours. 
5. After the dough has risen, you need to knead your dough again for 2-3 minutes, then cut out the dough. Shape each piece to a ball, and then cover them with a bit of flour and a towel and let them rise for another hour.
6. And voilà, you are ready!


### Tips
You can use some semolina flour take make your pizzas less likely to stick if you use a pizza peel.
