# fishy pizza sauce
This is the default sauce I use for my homemade pizzas. What makes this sauce special is that it uses anchovies and "San Marzano" tomatoes. "San Marzano" tomatoes can be hard to come by, so if you can’t find any, then order some online because they are worth it.

**Preparation**: 50 min  
**Makes**: sauce for ~8 pizzas

## Ingredients 
  * 0.5 dl olive oil
  * 2 anchovy filets
  * 4 cloves garlic, minced
  * 2 tbsp fresh oregano, chopped
  * 1 tsp dried oregano
  * 1 tsp red pepper flakes
  * 1 tsp sugar
  * 2 cans of whole peeled "San Marzano" tomatoes (400g each)
  * salt and pepper for tasting
  
## Directions

1. Add olive oil to a pot and set it to medium-low heat. 
2. Once warm, add your two anchovy fillets. Fry them until they start sizzling.
3. Add your minced garlic, and cook it for about 60 seconds. You dont want to brown it.
4. Add your fresh oregano, and bring to low heat. Cook it for 1-2 minutes.
5. Add your red peppers and dired oregano. Cook it for 1-2 minutes.
6. While cooking, open your two cans of "San Marzano" tomatoes and throw them into a bowl and crush them with your hands. Keep crushing them until you have a puree.
7. Add your crushed tomatoes to the pot and stir. Bring to medium heat.
8. Add salt, pepper and sugar 
9. Simmer gently for 35-40 minutes
10. And voilà, you are ready!
