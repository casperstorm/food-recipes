4dl water (room temp)
600g flour (I used Manitoba)
8g sugar (helps caramelizing the crust at ‘lower’ temperatures of regular ovens)
20g salt
15g olive oil
1g yeast (I use organic cake yeast)
1-2 tsp sourdough (can be left out but gives the dough a light zesty flavour - consider adding another gram of yeast if you don’t use sour dough)

Day 1

In a bowl

Dissolve sugar, yeast and sourdough (if using) into water.
Add flour - start by mixing in half till all lumps are gone, then the rest
Let dough rest for 20 mins - get the yeast starting
Add olive oil + salt - knead until it's mostly absorbed, then move the dough to a clean table
On the table

Kneading: Knead thoroughly, at least 15-20 min, by folding the dough on top of itself and pressing down - repeat. Clean your hands with a tiny amount of flour if it gets too sticky. Or use a stand mixer if you’re that lucky.
Rest: After kneading, lets rest for about 20 min. Either on the table covered in a damp cloth or in a covered bowl.
Stretch & fold - When the dough has rested 20 min and loosened up a bit, stretch it out in one side, and fold it onto itself. Repeat this for all 4 sides of the dough or until it gets too tight to stretch. This builds strength in the dough and lets it proof a bit before being transferred to the fridge.
Rest 20 min.

Proofing

Transfer dough to a bowl. Cover tightly in plastic wrap
Proofing: Put in a fridge for 24-48 hours (I proofed mine about 40 hours; transferred to the fridge around midnight day 1, and used shaped them into balls around 16:00 on day 3)
Day 2-3 (depending on proofing duration)

On the table

Remove dough from fridge and place on the table. It should be quite strong and let go of the bowl by itself rather easily without sticking.
Dividing balls: Divide into 3-4 chunks with a spatula using a weight to divide evenly. 3 big pizze (around 330g or 4 smaller.)
Shaping: Tug the balls under itself until the top is smooth and round. Place with folded side down on a clean baking tray and cover with plastic wrap.
In a baking tray

Proofing/resting: let the dough rest for 4-5 hours at room temperature to let the dough balls relax. If you rest too little you won’t be able to shape them, if they rest way too long they will overproof and collapse.
Make your pizza by pressing the air from the the center of the balls and outwards, creating airbubles in the crust!

Bake in an oven on max temp. I use a baking steel. Experiment using the top grill in the oven for half the baking duration to shock the dough with heat once it enters the oven.
